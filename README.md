# Challenge Alura Store

This is a fictional project created for the Alura data analysis challenge. The goal was to help Mr. Jo達o, owner of the Alura Store chain, decide which store should be put up for sale.

## Project Objectives

- Evaluate the performance of the four Alura Store locations: Conduct a detailed analysis of sales data, performance metrics, and customer reviews for each store.
- Identify the lowest performing store: Determine which of the four stores is showing the poorest results based on the analyzed criteria.
- Present a clear, data-backed recommendation to Mr. Jo達o: Provide a final recommendation, supported by concrete data, on which store should be sold or improved.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Analysis
Several metrics were analyzed for each store, including:

- Total revenue
- Best-selling product categories
- Customer reviews
- Top-selling products
- Average shipping cost
- Geographic analysis

### 2. Data Visualization
To communicate insights clearly and objectively, charts were created using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, including:

- Bar charts
- Column charts
- Pie charts

### 3. Final Recommendation
Based on the analyses and visualizations, a report was prepared in the file Challenge_Alura_Store.ipynb, explaining which store Mr. Jo達o should sell and the reasons for the choice, supported by the data.

## Result

Upon completing the project, it was possible to identify the least efficient store based on real data from this fictional business. From this analysis, a solid, data-driven recommendation was offered to assist Mr. Jo達o in making his decision.

## Note

This project was developed as part of a data analysis challenge promoted by Alura. The data used is fictional and intended exclusively for educational purposes.
